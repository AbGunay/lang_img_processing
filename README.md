# This is the project that was worked for Languag and Image Processing course

The purpose of the project is to implement and evaluate the four different image captioning models which are suggested in this [paper](https://github.com/AbGunay/lang_img_processing/blob/master/1703.09137.pdf). 

As a dataset, Flickr8K was used: [Flickr8K images](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/releases/download/Flickr8k/Flickr8k_Dataset.zip), [Flickr8K texts](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/releases/download/Flickr8k/Flickr8k_text.zip)
